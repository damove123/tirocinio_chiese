# Floor Tiles Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Floor Tiles project! This project aims to showcase and document various types of floor tiles found in churches, specifically focusing on those in the Venice area. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide an educational resource for enthusiasts, historians, and anyone interested in the diverse range of floor tiles used in religious architecture, particularly in Venice.

## Problems and Ideas:

Maps :
- The APIKeys and IDs of the maps are visibile from the inspection tool of the webpage: need to fix it hiding them in some way

Styles :
- there is no consistency in the styles. 

Index.html : 
- menu with help, credits
- compress the page

Arcgis : 
- eliminate the sketch layer, create a FeatureLayer with popups of the church from which you can click and opens result.html with the artifacts
- missing floor-plants and artifacts
- add layer 'chiese_laguna'
- link artifacts_layer and data_artifacts to color artifacts by degree of completion (same for churches)
- search for a good satellite base-map
- fix alignment of search-box in map

JS : 
- Extraction JS code from all the html files 

Transcription: 
- help for transcription syntax (look in 2004 box)

result.html : 
- artifact's botton smaller
- IDEA : the button is thought with an addition of "Floor image", "Arts", ecc (The data exist in the 2004 bucket on FIrebase and AWS S3)
- show number of artifacts, number of inscription, number of incomplete artifacts : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0OByWWDto5QMQCBp8fMlwid5n7-xADqeJoRoAwrjF4/edit

clickReperto.hmtl : 
- add a library/function for photo manipulation (rotation, sharpening)

Churches: 
- link the database of the churches (remove the reading from the csv)
- create an ULTIMATE database for the churches 

Artifact
- add some fields like "Name", "Surname", "Profession"... as in the reperti.csv file of 2004
