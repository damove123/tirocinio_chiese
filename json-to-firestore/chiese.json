The funder of this project, Michele Tommasi, is commemorated in a bust over the main entrance. The church’s many doors and windows bring in lots of light and add to the church’s open feeling. The façade was damaged in a 1998 fire, but was undergoing restoration as of 2008.",

The current church was built in the 15th century with a Gothic/Renaissance façade.  Saved from suppression during Napoleon’s rule of Venice, the convent took in many displaced nuns.   San Zaccaria has an expansive history with Doges, partly due to its proximity to the [[Basilica of San Marco]] and the [[Doge’s Palace]]. Three Doges were assassinated on the streets surrounding San Zaccaria, one was even killed on the steps leading to the church entrance. The convent was also forced to give their orchard to the Doge when the Piazza di San Marco was being planned, as it stood between the planned Basilica and the Lagoon.",

The body of Saint Stephen was brought to rest in 1109 from Constantinople and in celebration of the Saint’s feast day, December 26th, Venetians floated thousands of candles in Bacino di San Marco. This tradition ended with the fall of the Republic in 1797.\nThe church and monastery were damaged by an earthquake in 1223 and rebuilt by Doge Pietro Ziani, who later retreated to the island. A second rebuilding occurred in 1565 by Palladio who replaced the Gothic church and enlarged the monastery. In 1851 the church and monastery were given to military authorities. During this change of hands, the church was badly damaged and fell into disrepair. In 1951, the Giorgio Cini Foundation funded a complete restoration of the church and brought back its reputation as \"an institute of lofty historical artistic culture\".",
